🌟 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🌟

I’m thrilled to showcase the completion of the HRX UI Clone project, where I had the privilege to lead an incredible team as the Team Captain. This project involved creating a pixel-perfect UI design inspired by the "HRX" website.

This journey was more than just coding—it was about team collaboration, leadership, and bringing designs to life with precision and creativity. Special thanks to our Mentor for the guidance and support throughout this journey.

This project reinforced my skills in UI/UX development, strengthened my leadership abilities, and showcased the power of teamwork in achieving excellence.

Looking forward to exploring more challenging opportunities in web development! 🚀
